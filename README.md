# cups

Deploy [CUPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS) on Openshift.

> Note: this is to test running the registry.redhat.io/rhel9/cups:latest image.

```sh
helm upgrade -i cups helm/cups -n cups --create-namespace \
  --set-file=config.cupsd=examples/cupsd.conf \
  --set-file=config.printers=examples/printers.conf
```

expose with route (for testing)...

```sh
export INGRESS_DOMAIN=$(oc get ingress.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath={.spec.domain})
helm upgrade -i cups helm/cups -n cups --create-namespace \
  -f helm/cups/values-expose.yaml \
  --set ingress.hosts[0].host=cups-cups.${INGRESS_DOMAIN} \
  --set-file=config.cupsd=examples/cupsd.conf \
  --set-file=config.printers=examples/printers.conf
```

or...

```sh
oc port-forward $(oc get pods -n cups -o name) -n cups 6631:6631
```

## build & publish

```sh
export IMG_REGISTRY= # quay.io/trevorbox/cups
podman build -t ${IMG_REGISTRY}:latest .
# run locally...
podman run -it --rm --entrypoint "/bin/bash" ${IMG_REGISTRY}:latest
podman push ${IMG_REGISTRY}:latest
```

test published image...

```sh
helm upgrade -i cups helm/cups -n cups --create-namespace \
  --set image.repository=${IMG_REGISTRY} \
  --set-file=config.cupsd=examples/cupsd.conf \
  --set-file=config.printers=examples/printers.conf
```

## CUPS Printer Drivers and Configurations.

A typical CUPS install provides printer drivers dynamically by using a driver information file (.drv) and creating a PPD driver file that can be used by CUPS printers. By default, when a printer is configured in CUPS, the PPD driver is saved to the /etc/cups/ppd/ directory, and the printer definition is added to the /etc/cups/printers.conf file. The printers.conf file can hold information for more than one printer and required PPD files can be added to the /etc/cups/ppd/ directory.

If the printer configurations (/etc/cups/printers.conf) and drivers (/etc/cups/ppd/) that are required are known these can be included in builds.

## Sending Test Print Jobs

To test printing from the command line, you can use the lp command which is provided from the cups-client.rpm
To send a test print job from the command line of a client:
```sh
echo "Test Message Content" | lp -d printer_name
```
Or,
```sh
lp -d printer_name /path/to/file
```

Cups provides test files in the /usr/share/cups/data/ directory.
You can add a different job name by using the -t (title) option with a messages:
```sh
lp -d printer_name -t "Print Job XYZ" /usr/share/cups/data/default-testpage.pdf
```

Finally, from the CUPS UI, select a printer and then in the Maintenance drop down list select "Print Test Page"
